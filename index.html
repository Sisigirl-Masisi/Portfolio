                <h2><span id="typed-element"></span></h2>
                <p>I’m a final-year student at IT Certification Academy (ITCA) in Potchefstroom, currently completing a two-year Systems Development course. I’ve also completed the Professional Development Skills program with ALX and continue to expand my expertise through certifications in cybersecurity.
                    As a freelancer and web designer, I work with small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to help them grow digitally and make their services more accessible to their customers. This not only supports their business goals but also allows me to strengthen my skills through real-world, practical experience.
                    I’m currently working my way into cloud computing to broaden my technical skill set and stay aligned with industry trends. I also plan to further my studies by obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering to deepen my knowledge and open up more advanced opportunities.
                    With a growing background in software development, backend technologies, and cybersecurity, I am committed to continuous learning and building secure, scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.

                <h3>C#</h3>
                <p>The first programming language I learned was C#. It was intriguing and fun to explore. <br>
                I didn't know about it until I took it upon myself to do extra work after my classes at school <br>

                <p>Next, we moved on to learning SQL. Initially, I found the theory easier to grasp, but I struggled with practical implementation. Eventually, I went through the material again and used resources like YouTube and W3Schools to better understand SQL.</p>
