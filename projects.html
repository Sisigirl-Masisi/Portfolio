                <p>This was a fun project I decided to do to practice my coding skills. I saw a video on TikTok and YouTube and challenged myself to recreate the game for fun!</p>

                <p>Just like Project One, this was another personal challenge. I wanted to practice coding after watching more videos on YouTube, and I decided to build something useful!</p>

                <p>Similar to the previous projects, I built this as part of my self-learning. It helped me gain more experience with coding and problem-solving!</p>

                <p>This was a peer project I did with my team, ALX Power Circle, during our Professional Foundations week at ALX. I served as the Project Manager while Marizile led as Product Manager. We focused on Women Empowerment and collaborated across regions—it was a meaningful and enriching experience.</p>
